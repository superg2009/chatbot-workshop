# NLP - Natural Language Processing 

## Human vs Computer understanding of language

Human’s have been writing things down for thousands of years. Over that time, our brain has gained a tremendous amount of experience in understanding natural language. When we read something written on a piece of paper or in a blog post on the internet, we understand what that thing really means in the real-world. We feel the emotions that reading that thing elicits and we often visualise how that thing would look in real life.

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is a sub-field of ***Artificial Intelligene*** that is focused on enabling computers to understand and process human languages, to get computers closer to a human-level understanding of language. Computers don’t yet have the same intuitive understanding of natural language that humans do. They can’t really understand what the language is really trying to say. In a nutshell, a computer can’t read between the lines.

That being said, recent advances in ***Machine Learning (ML)*** have enabled computers to do quite a lot of useful things with natural language! Deep Learning has enabled us to write programs to perform things like language translation, semantic understanding, and text summarization. All of these things add real-world value, making it easy for you to understand and perform computations on large blocks of text without the manual effort.
