#Small Talk

Dialogflow provides two out-of-the-box features that help get you started with agent and conversation design: Small Talk.

Small Talk is used to provide responses to casual conversation. This feature can greatly improve the user experience by covering common questions that may not pertain to your agent's intents you built.

Enable Small Talk for an agent
Small Talk can either be enabled for your agent or imported as a Prebuilt Agent. To enable Small Talk for your agent, follow these steps:

Click Small Talk in the left menu.
Click on the switch to enable.
Click SAVE.
