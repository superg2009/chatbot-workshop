Dialogflow provides two out-of-the-box features that help get you started with agent and conversation design: Prebuilt Agents.

Prebuilt Agents
Prebuilt Agents are a collection of agents developed by the Dialogflow team that are aimed at covering specific use cases. These can be used to establish a base for building conversations that cover specific topics, like dining out, hotel booking, and navigation.

Prebuilt Agents include intents and entities that cover the agent's topic. You need to provide responses since they may depend on particular use cases or need to be retrieved from external sources (webhook or third-party API).

Import a Prebuilt Agent
To add a Prebuilt Agent to your account, follow these steps:

Click Prebuilt Agents in the left menu.
Click on a Prebuilt Agent tile to get more information.
Click IMPORT.
Either create a new Google project or choose an existing one.
