# Prebuilt Agents

> Dialogflow provides two out-of-the-box features that help get you started with agent and conversation design: Prebuilt Agents.

## Prebuilt Agents

Prebuilt Agents are a collection of agents developed by the Dialogflow team that are aimed at covering specific use cases. These can be used to establish a base for building conversations that cover specific topics, like dining out, hotel booking, and navigation.

Prebuilt Agents include intents and entities that cover the agent's topic. You need to provide responses since they may depend on particular use cases or need to be retrieved from external sources (webhook or third-party API).

> Note: Importing a Prebuilt Agent creates a new agent. If you want to include Prebuilt Agent functionality into an existing agent, you'll need to move the intents from the newly created Prebuilt Agent into your existing agent.

### Import a Prebuilt Agent

To add a Prebuilt Agent to your account, follow these steps:

1. Click **Prebuilt Agents** in the left menu.
2. Click on a Prebuilt Agent tile to get more information.
3. Click **IMPORT**.
4. Either create a new Google project or choose an existing one.
5. Click **OK**.

## Small Talk

Small Talk is used to provide responses to casual conversation. This feature can greatly improve the user experience by covering common questions that may not pertain to your agent's intents you built.

> Note: Responses for the Small Talk agent are only supported in English (en), Russian (ru), French (fr), and Italian (it) at this time.

### Enable Small Talk for an agent

Small Talk can either be enabled for your agent or imported as a Prebuilt Agent. To enable Small Talk for your agent, follow these steps:

1. Click **Small Talk** in the left menu.
2. Click on the switch to enable.
3. Click **SAVE**.

### Customize Small Talk responses

Once enabled, Small Talk responses can be customized to fit your branding or product needs. Each response category is organized in folders. To customize responses, follow these steps:

1. Click on **Small Talk** in the left menu.
2. Click on a response category folder.
3. Add new or edit existing responses.
