# Intents overview

Simply put, intents are the intentions of the end-user, these intentions or intents are conveyed by the user to your bot. 


Intents that directly map to business of the bot. For eg — if it’s a Movie information Bot then an utterance from client like “When was Schindler’s list released?” is a business intent that intends to find out the Release year of Schindler’s list and you should label it accordingly with an understandable name like “GetReleaseYearByTitle”.

Ideally you should think more about business intents because rest of small talk like saying hellos or affirming choices is taken care by general casual intents. 

Intent examples: 

- “I want to book a flight” --> Booking a flight ticket is the intent here
- "I want to order food" --> Ordering food is the intent here
- "Where is your office in Kamloops" --> Office Address is the intent
